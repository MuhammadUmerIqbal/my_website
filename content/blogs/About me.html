<p>Hello, my name is Muhammad Umer Iqbal.</p>
<p>Originally from Pakistan, I now call London my chosen home.</p>
<p>I am currently pursuing the Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School. My undergraduate degree was a Bachelor of Management Sciences with double specialisation in finance and accounting.</p>
<p>Personally, I am a theatre artist and love watching movies. I enjoy an active and healthy lifestyle. I’m also a friend to many and enjoy having fun conversations.</p>
<p>Feel free to HMU for a coffee! ☕️</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy learning more about me from my website - see you around!</p>
