Hello, my name is Muhammad Umer Iqbal. 

Originally from Pakistan, I now call London my chosen home. 

I am currently pursuing the Masters in Financial Analysis at London Business School. My undergraduate degree was a Bachelor of Management Sciences with double specialisation in finance and accounting. 

Personally, I am a theatre artist and love watching movies. I enjoy an active and healthy lifestyle. I’m also a friend to many and enjoy having fun conversations. 

Feel free to HMU for a coffee! ☕️ 

I hope you enjoy learning more about me from my website - see you around!
